        Given a sorted list 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and using the recursive binary search algorithm, identify the sequence of 
    numbers that each recursive call will search to try and find 8.

        ANSWER: It would start at 11, see the number is less then go to 8 and see they are the same

        Given a sorted list 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18 and using the recursive binary search algorithm, identify the sequence of numbers 
    that each recursive call will search to try and find 16.

        ANSWER: It would start at 11, then go to 12 -> 14 -> 15 then see that the start and end are the same and wont call itself again
